## Intro/Landing Page

I’m a Master of Public Health candidate at Columbia University specializing in Population and Family Health. My work focuses on community-based research, health equity, and program evaluation. I’m passionate about using data and storytelling to bridge the gap between research and practice — particularly in mental health, adolescent health, and HIV prevention.

This site was created as part of my Data Science 1 course, where I’m learning to use R for data visualization, analysis, and reproducible research. It’s a space to explore how coding and data science can complement my professional experiences in global and community health !!! 

This website creation included using templates from the interactivity module by Jeff Goldsmith from [P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html).
